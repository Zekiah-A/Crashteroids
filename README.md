# Crashteroids

## The background:
Crashteroids is based off a pen and paper game where you play as a ship (originally a dot on the page), and must aim and bounce off of of "asteroids" to hit into your opponent, killing them and winning the game.

### How to play:
 - Click / press to move the rocket in a certain direction.
 - Use Tools or items from the Rocket Editor in order to predict where it will bounce.
 - Crash into your opponent in order to win.

### Other info:
The game features multiple modes, currently 2 player has been implemented, but it is planned to feature Peer-To-Peer local online, and server-based global online, along with a map maker, so that players can design their own levels. 

## Todo:

* Add background match space parrallax effects
* Add shadows coming off of ships, rocket booster lighting, and other cool lighting
* Map maker
* Implement rounds system
* Fix all "TODO"s
* Unjank the saving and loading system, also fix saving/loading on android.
* Make Match.cs just be part of GameManager
* Fix UI scaling
* Tools
* Rank sytem
* Control options in settings
* Implement all gamemodes.
* Update to Godot 4 (when stable).
* Much more!

## Contributions:
Contributions in any capacity, be it bug fixes, new items, or new features in total would be greatly appreciated. I aim for this game to be fully open source and free for everyone to play.

### Contributors notes:
 * The game is coded on the godot engine, to avoid complication, C# should be used instead of gdscript.
 * Usage of [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and [Krita](https://krita.org/) is reccomended, as the game's raw sprites should be either in .kra or .svg formats (with the ones actually used in the game being in .png, due to engine limitations).
 * Usage of any external libraries / software / code is fine, as long as it is properly credited, and licenses are followed.
 * The game is currently on Godot 3.3.
